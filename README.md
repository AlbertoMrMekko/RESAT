# RESAT

RESAT (Registro de Entradas y Salidas del √Årea de Trabajo) is a desktop application for companies that need to keep a
record of when their employees enter and leave the work area.

## Main Features

- Create Employee: In the left sidebar of the application, the employee can click the "+" button to access the employee
  creation form. This form requires the employee's name, ID, and password.
- Switch Employee: All employees in the system will appear in the left sidebar of the application. Clicking on any
  employee will display the available user actions.
- View Employee Status: In the left sidebar, a status bar will appear next to each employee. A red bar indicates that
  the employee is outside the work area, while a green bar indicates that the employee is in the work area.
- Automatic Registration: In the employee actions window, the user can select "Enter" or "Exit" to register the action
  immediately. Identification is required to validate the action.
- Manual Registration: In the employee actions window, the user can select "Manual Registration" to register an entry or
  exit for previous dates through a form. After confirming the action and identifying the employee, the system will
  validate the action and record the corresponding entry or exit.
- Download Registry: In the employee actions window, the user can select "Download Registry" to download the complete
  entry and exit log to the selected location. Identification is required to validate the action. Before the download
  is processed, the system will check for any inconsistencies in the records. If inconsistencies are found, an alert
  will be displayed indicating the issue and how to resolve it.
- Delete Employee: In the employee actions window, the user can select "Delete Employee" to permanently remove their
  user from the system. Confirmation is required, and the employee's records will be maintained in the registry even
  after deletion.
